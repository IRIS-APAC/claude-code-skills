## 5. Mapping to Implementation

### From Customer Experience to Requirements

**Customer Need → Functional Requirement → Technical Implementation**

#### Example Mapping

**Customer Experience**: "User searches for 'vacation policy' and finds relevant results in < 1 second"

↓

**Functional Requirements**:

- FR-4: System must respond within 500ms (P95)

↓

**Technical Implementation**:
- Tech-1: Implement query embedding via AWS Bedrock
- Tech-2: Build hybrid search (BM25 + vector) using OpenSearch
- Tech-3: Apply RBAC filter before returning results
- Tech-4: Cache embeddings and implement async processing

↓

**Epics/Stories**:
- Epic 1: Search Infrastructure
  - Story 1.1: Set up OpenSearch Serverless
  - Story 1.2: Implement embedding service
  - Story 1.3: Build hybrid search API
- Epic 2: Authorization

- Expand on value proposition
- Add technical approach at high level
- Include cost/performance analysis

**2. Customer Experience + User Manual → Detailed Requirements**
- Convert user journeys to user stories
- Add acceptance criteria
- Define non-functional requirements

**3. Implementation Mapping → Architecture & System Design**
- Detail technical components
- Define APIs and interfaces
- Specify infrastructure and deployment

**4. Success Criteria → Testing & Acceptance**
