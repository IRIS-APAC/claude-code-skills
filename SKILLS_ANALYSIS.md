# Skills Conversion Analysis

## Recommended Skills to Create

Based on analysis of CLAUDE.md and related documentation, here are the skills that should be created to replace/supplement existing markdown documentation.

---

## 1. `agile-board` skill ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Purpose**: Generic agile board integration with dynamic configuration

**Architecture**: Single skill with setup script that detects board type

**Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/agile-board/
├── SKILL.md                    # Generic board operations, setup instructions
├── config.json                 # Generated by setup (gitignored)
├── scripts/
│   └── setup.py                # Interactive setup - asks which board type
└── references/
    ├── zenhub.md               # ZenHub-specific MCP tools and field mappings
    ├── jira.md                 # Jira-specific MCP tools and field mappings
    └── linear.md               # Linear-specific (future)
```

**Trigger description**:
```yaml
name: agile-board
description: "Agile board integration for ticket management. Use when: creating issues, managing sprints, updating ticket status. Supports Jira, ZenHub, and Linear. On first use, run setup if config.json is missing."
```

**What moves from existing docs**:
- From `ZENHUB_WORKFLOW.md` → `references/zenhub.md`:
  - Issue type IDs (Epic, Feature, Bug)
  - Pipeline IDs
  - MCP tool usage (`mcp__zenhub__createGitHubIssue`, etc.)
  - Critical rules (use GitHub issues, set estimates in dedicated field, link to parent)
  - Label strategy

- From `ESTIMATION_GUIDE.md` → Keep in `project-management` skill (see below)

**Setup workflow**:
1. User triggers skill: "Create a ticket for login bug"
2. Claude reads SKILL.md, checks for config.json
3. If missing → runs `python scripts/setup.py`
4. Setup asks: Jira/ZenHub/Linear? Workspace ID? Repository ID?
5. Writes config.json with board_type
6. Claude loads `references/{board_type}.md` for implementation

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Portable across projects and teams
- ✅ One skill to maintain
- ✅ Easy to switch boards (delete config, re-run setup)
- ✅ Works with multi-board teams (internal team uses ZenHub, clients use Jira)

---

## 2. `project-management` skill ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Purpose**: Generic agile workflows (board-agnostic)

**Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/project-management/
├── SKILL.md                    # Core workflows, best practices
└── references/
    ├── story-templates.md      # User story format, acceptance criteria
    ├── estimation-guide.md     # T-shirt sizing (XS=1, S=3, M=5, L=8, XL=13)
    └── sprint-workflows.md     # Sprint planning, retrospectives
```

**Trigger description**:
```yaml
name: project-management
description: "Agile project management workflows for creating tickets, managing sprints, writing acceptance criteria, and setting estimates. Use when: (1) Writing user stories, (2) Creating acceptance criteria, (3) Estimating story points, (4) Sprint planning, (5) Breaking down large stories. Works with any agile board (requires agile-board skill)."
```

**What moves from existing docs**:
- From `ESTIMATION_GUIDE.md` → `references/estimation-guide.md`:
  - T-shirt size mapping (XS=1, S=3, M=5, L=8, XL=13)
  - Complexity factor checklist
  - When to break down large stories (L/XL)

- From `ZENHUB_WORKFLOW.md` → `references/story-templates.md`:
  - User story format
  - Acceptance criteria format (`- [ ]` checkboxes)
  - DO/DON'T lists for stories

**Relationship to agile-board skill**:
- `project-management` = "what to create" (story structure, estimates)
- `agile-board` = "how to create it" (MCP tools, field mappings)

---

## 3. `git-workflow` skill ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Purpose**: GitFlow branching, commit conventions, PR creation

**Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/git-workflow/
├── SKILL.md                    # Branch naming, commit format, CRITICAL rules
└── references/
    └── pr-template.md          # PR description template
```

**Trigger description**:
```yaml
name: git-workflow
description: "GitFlow branching strategy and commit conventions. Use when: (1) Creating branches (feature/bugfix/hotfix), (2) Writing commit messages, (3) Creating pull requests, (4) Merging code. CRITICAL: Feature/bugfix always target develop, NOT main."
```

**What moves from existing docs**:
- From `CLAUDE.md` Development Workflow section:
  - Branch naming conventions (`feature/epic-X-story-Y.Z-description`)
  - Commit message format (`type(scope): description`)
  - PR guidelines and template
  - Merge strategy (merge commits, NOT squash/rebase)

**Critical rules in SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## CRITICAL RULES

- ✅ Feature/bugfix branches → `develop` (NOT main)
- ✅ Release branches → `main` (only for official releases)
- ✅ Use merge commits (NOT --squash or --rebase)
- ❌ NEVER attribute commits to AI ("Co-Authored-By: Claude")
- ✅ Australian English in all commit messages
- ✅ Verify target branch: `gh pr view {PR} --json baseRefName`
```

---

## 4. `design-patterns` skill ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Consider as reference)

**Purpose**: Architecture patterns and code abstraction guidelines

**Consideration**: `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md` is 1,223 lines. This might be:
- **Too large for a skill** (>5k words target)
- **Better as reference documentation** (consulted when needed, not always loaded)

**Alternative approach**: Create a lightweight skill that references the full guide:
```
.claude/skills/design-patterns/
├── SKILL.md                    # Core principles, when to abstract checklist
└── references/
    ├── search-api-base.md      # SearchAPIBase pattern (excerpt)
    ├── pipeline-worker-base.md # Template Method pattern (excerpt)
    └── full-guide.md           # Link to docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md
```

**Trigger description**:
```yaml
name: design-patterns
description: "Code architecture patterns and abstraction guidelines. Use when: (1) Designing new modules, (2) Implementing SearchAPIBase or PipelineWorkerBase subclasses, (3) Questions about DRY principle or when to abstract, (4) Choosing inheritance vs composition."
```

**Recommendation**: Start without this skill, use the markdown guide directly. Add skill later if patterns are frequently referenced.

---

## Why Australian English is NOT a Skill

**Australian English should remain in CLAUDE.md as a mandatory project-wide standard.**

**Reasoning**:
- ❌ **Not conditionally triggered** - Should ALWAYS be enforced, not loaded when "relevant"
- ❌ **No trigger point** - User saying "normalize" won't make Claude think "load spelling skill"
- ✅ **Always in context** - Needs to be visible for every response, not progressive disclosure
- ✅ **Project constraint** - Like using Python 3.12 or ap-southeast-2 region

**Better approach**: Keep Australian English rules at the top of CLAUDE.md where they're always visible.

---

## Documents That Should STAY as Markdown

### 1. **Requirements & Architecture** (Large reference documents)
- `docs/Design/system-requirements.md` (large)
- `docs/Design/system-architecture.md` (large)
- **Why**: Reference documents Claude reads when needed, not workflows

### 2. **Story Implementation Guides** (One-time use)
- `docs/stories/STORY_1.1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `docs/stories/CAPTION_GENERATION.md`
- **Why**: Historical implementation guides, not ongoing workflows

### 3. **Configuration Guides** (Reference)
- `docs/guides/FUNNELBACK_CONFIGURATION.md`
- `docs/guides/SHAREPOINT_CONFIGURATION.md`
- `docs/guides/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` (1,960 lines - too large)
- **Why**: Occasionally consulted, not part of daily workflows

### 4. **Error Handling** (Reference)
- `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md`
- **Why**: HTTP status code reference, looked up as needed

### 5. **ZenHub Setup** (One-time MCP configuration)
- `docs/project-management/ZENHUB_CLAUDE_SETUP.md`
- **Why**: One-time MCP server setup, not daily workflow

---

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Agile Workflow (Highest ROI)
1. **`agile-board`** skill - Most frequent use, highest automation value
2. **`project-management`** skill - Generic story/estimation workflows
3. Test: Create a story end-to-end using both skills

### Phase 2: Development Standards
4. **`git-workflow`** skill - Prevent branch target mistakes

### Phase 3: Optional (Evaluate Need)
5. **`design-patterns`** skill - Only if frequently consulted

---

## Skill Locations

### Recommended: Global skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
- ✅ Works across all projects
- ✅ Portable (copy to new machines)
- ✅ config.json makes them project-specific when needed

### Alternative: Per-project in `.claude/skills/`
- ⚠️ Need to copy skills to each project
- ⚠️ Harder to keep in sync across projects

---

## Root CLAUDE.md Changes

After skills are created, update `CLAUDE.md` to:
1. Reference the skills instead of duplicating content
2. Keep project-specific context (KB_ID, architecture principles)
3. Add "Skills Used" section:

```markdown
## Example: Skills Used in a Project

- **agile-board** - ZenHub integration (config: project workspace)
- **project-management** - Story templates, estimation
- **git-workflow** - GitFlow branching (develop → main)

See `~/.claude/skills/` for skill documentation.

**Note**: Australian English spelling is enforced project-wide via CLAUDE.md (not a skill).
```

---

## Team Sharing Strategy

### Recommended: Skills Repository with Setup Script

Create a dedicated skills repository that team members can easily install:

**Repository Structure**:
```
claude-code-skills/                     # Git repository
├── README.md                           # Setup instructions
├── .gitignore                          # Ignore config.json files
├── git-workflow/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
├── agile-board/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── config.json.example             # Template, not actual config
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── references/
├── project-management/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
└── install-skills.sh                   # Linux/Mac setup script
└── install-skills.ps1                  # Windows setup script
```

**Linux/Mac Setup Script** (`install-skills.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash

SKILLS_REPO="git@github.com:your-org/claude-code-skills.git"
SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills"

echo "📦 Claude Code Skills Installer"
echo ""

# Check if skills directory exists
if [ ! -d "$SKILLS_DIR" ]; then
    echo "📥 Cloning skills repository..."
    git clone "$SKILLS_REPO" "$SKILLS_DIR"
    echo "✅ Skills installed in $SKILLS_DIR"
else
    echo "🔄 Updating existing skills..."
    cd "$SKILLS_DIR" && git pull
    echo "✅ Skills updated"
fi

echo ""
echo "Available skills:"
ls -1 "$SKILLS_DIR" | grep -v "\.git\|README\|install"

echo ""
echo "📝 Next steps:"
echo "   - Skills are now available globally for all projects"
echo "   - Run 'python ~/.claude/skills/agile-board/scripts/setup.py' to configure your board"
echo "   - See ~/.claude/skills/README.md for usage"
```

**Windows Setup Script** (`install-skills.ps1`):
```powershell
# Claude Code Skills Installer (Windows)

$SKILLS_REPO = "git@github.com:your-org/claude-code-skills.git"
$SKILLS_DIR = "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"

Write-Host "📦 Claude Code Skills Installer" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host ""

# Check if skills directory exists
if (-Not (Test-Path $SKILLS_DIR)) {
    Write-Host "📥 Cloning skills repository..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    git clone $SKILLS_REPO $SKILLS_DIR
    Write-Host "✅ Skills installed in $SKILLS_DIR" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "🔄 Updating existing skills..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Set-Location $SKILLS_DIR
    git pull
    Write-Host "✅ Skills updated" -ForegroundColor Green
}

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Available skills:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Get-ChildItem $SKILLS_DIR -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -notmatch "^\.git$" } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "📝 Next steps:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   - Skills are now available globally for all projects"
Write-Host "   - Run 'python $SKILLS_DIR\agile-board\scripts\setup.py' to configure your board"
Write-Host "   - See $SKILLS_DIR\README.md for usage"
```

**Usage for Team Members**:

Linux/Mac:
```bash
# One-time setup
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/claude-code-skills/main/install-skills.sh
chmod +x install-skills.sh
./install-skills.sh

# Update skills later
./install-skills.sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
# One-time setup
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/claude-code-skills/main/install-skills.ps1" -OutFile "install-skills.ps1"
.\install-skills.ps1

# Update skills later
.\install-skills.ps1
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ One command setup for new team members
- ✅ Easy updates (`git pull` inside script)
- ✅ Cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows)
- ✅ Global skills work across all projects
- ✅ Version controlled in git

**What to Version Control**:
- ✅ `SKILL.md` files
- ✅ `references/` documentation
- ✅ `scripts/setup.py` templates
- ✅ `config.json.example` templates
- ✅ Install scripts

**What NOT to Commit**:
- ❌ `config.json` (personal workspace IDs, API tokens)
- ❌ Any credentials or secrets

## Benefits of Skills Over Markdown

1. **Progressive disclosure**: Only load what's needed when needed
2. **Composable**: Combine multiple skills (git-workflow + agile-board)
3. **Portable**: Copy skills to other projects/machines
4. **Triggerable**: Claude knows when to use them automatically
5. **Smaller context**: <5k words per skill vs large markdown files

---

## Key Design Principles

From the skill-creator documentation:

1. **Concise is key** - Only add context Claude doesn't already have
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Core in SKILL.md, details in references/
3. **Good descriptions** - Primary trigger mechanism, include "when to use"
4. **Scripts for automation** - Use scripts/ for repetitive tasks
5. **Cross-platform** - Use Python (not bash) for Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility

---

## Example: How Skills Work Together

**User**: "Create a story for implementing dark mode"

**Claude loads**:
1. `project-management/SKILL.md` - Gathers story structure, acceptance criteria, estimate
2. `agile-board/SKILL.md` - Checks config.json → sees "board_type": "zenhub"
3. `agile-board/references/zenhub.md` - Uses ZenHub MCP tools

**Claude creates**:
- GitHub issue with title, description, acceptance criteria
- Sets issue type to "Feature"
- Sets estimate (e.g., M = 5 points)
- Links to parent epic
- Moves to "Product Backlog" pipeline

**Australian English spelling** is automatically enforced because it's in CLAUDE.md (always in context)
